## req-016 loop

at:verify req-016 --tier loop
  AT-016.01    green    the one shared emitter is the sole writer; blockers/scope/lifecycle hold no direct send path
  AT-016.02    green    registered events equal the taxonomy exactly, are immutable, and carry no CR/scope-change event
  AT-016.03    green    every taxonomy row delivers to exactly its recipients on exactly its channels, with the named payloads
  AT-016.04    green    sensitive negatives: no candidacy to the NGO, no vetting outcome to the volunteer, no donation event
  AT-016.05    green    every critical class goes out by email; the low-tone event is in-app only
  AT-016.06    green    a documented delivery default exists for every taxonomy row
  AT-016.07    green    one logical event per committed event, one delivery per recipient-channel pair, across a restart
  AT-016.08    green    a comment burst delivers the count the pinned anti-spam configuration prescribes, on two different configurations
  AT-016.09    green    every guarded transition writes its notification event atomically under an induced fault
  AT-016.10    green    recipients resolve at event creation: the old holder receives, the new holder is excluded
  AT-016.11    green    sent only on provider acceptance; unconfirmed sends retry; a lost ack mints no duplicate
  AT-016.12    green    an escalation-tier event notifies both the NGO and the platform admin
  12 P0: 12 green, 0 red, 0 missing
  EXPECTED: the run matches C:\Users\nirdr\Downloads\ai4good\.claude\worktrees\AI4DEV-89\tests\at\expected\req-016.json exactly (12 declared green, 0 declared red)
