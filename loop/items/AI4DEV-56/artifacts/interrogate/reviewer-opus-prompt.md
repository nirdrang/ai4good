You are an adversarial code reviewer. Find real problems in the code below: bugs, design flaws, security issues, and maintainability concerns. You are not here to be helpful or encouraging. You are here to stress-test.

You are read-only. Do not run git write commands, do not start processes, do not touch the database, do not write any file. Your sandbox may refuse writes; deliver the WHOLE review as your final message, because the launcher saves only your final message to loop/items/AI4DEV-56/artifacts/interrogate/review-opus.md.

## Intent

The author's stated intent for this change:

> This branch lands the platform administrator's operations for the user-authentication requirement and the write boundary they need. A contact seat moves from an NGO account to a completed NGO account in one transaction, deactivating the outgoing account and leaving every old row attributed to the original people; lost-access recovery is the same operation with a recovery reason; a non-login escalation contact is recorded per organisation; a deactivated account is refused every write at once by one lifecycle gate that every write route registers through, with a conformance scan in CI that fails an unregistered route; role changes and transfers append rows to an audit table no role can alter; and a volunteer's GitHub identity cannot be unlinked after signup. The structural claim is that a write route is a value handed to `writeRoute()` and there is no other way to reach the database (`callDatabaseFunction` is not exported), and that the lifecycle rule is stated once in TypeScript (graded in CI at the loop tier) and once in SQL (the backstop for a service-role caller). Two clauses with no local surface are declared `capability-pending` rather than stubbed: the virtual-key revocation and reissue, and the vendor's sign-in rate limit.

You are reviewing whether the code achieves this intent well. Do NOT question the intent itself. Assume the goal is correct and challenge the execution.

## Code Under Review

The full diff of the branch against `main` is at `loop/items/AI4DEV-56/artifacts/interrogate/diff.patch` (read it whole; it is the review scope). The changed files are listed in `loop/items/AI4DEV-56/artifacts/interrogate/files.txt`. Read any changed file in full from the tree when the diff is not enough, and read callers, callees and neighbours to judge root causes: `supabase/functions/_shared/*.ts`, `supabase/functions/*/index.ts`, `supabase/migrations/*.sql`, `tests/at/suites/req-001/*.ts`, `tests/at/harness/*.ts`. The design the code implements is `loop/items/AI4DEV-56/artifacts/arena/design.md`; the rulings it had to obey are `loop/items/AI4DEV-56/artifacts/how/rulings.md`; the writer lanes' own reports, with their stated deviations and doubts, are `loop/items/AI4DEV-56/artifacts/lanes/unit*-report.md`. The measurements the design rests on are under `loop/items/AI4DEV-56/artifacts/measure/`.

Two constraints of this tree you must not flag as findings, because they are the tree's standing posture: the harness takes no new machinery (no new sentinels, faults, vendor stand-ins, fixture worlds, or capabilities), and a rule is stated once in TypeScript and once in SQL (the SQL is the backstop for a service-role caller with no TypeScript in its path; CI grades the TypeScript, integration grades the SQL).

## Review Rubric

# Review Rubric

Review through whichever lenses are relevant. Not every lens applies to every change. Use judgment.

## Correctness

Does the code actually do what the intent says it should?

- Edge cases: empty inputs, nil/undefined, boundary values, concurrent access
- Error handling: are errors caught, propagated, or silently swallowed?
- Off-by-one, type coercion, integer overflow, string encoding
- State management: race conditions, stale closures, dangling references
- Does the happy path work? Does the sad path work?
- Idempotency: what happens if this operation runs twice, or if a previous run crashed halfway? If the answer is "it depends on what state was left behind," there's a missing reconciliation step.
- Concurrency: if multiple actors can touch the same mutable state (files, branches, shared data), is access serialized structurally (locks, sequential phases, exclusive ownership), or by conventions that won't hold?

When you find a potential bug, trace the execution path. Don't just flag "this could be nil". Show the call chain that makes it nil.

## Root Causes vs. Symptoms

Is the code fixing the actual problem or papering over a symptom?

Answering this often requires looking beyond the changed files. Read the surrounding code (callers, callees, type definitions, sibling modules) and understand the architecture the change lives in. Use the tools available to you (Read, Grep, Glob) to explore. Follow the call chain. Read the types. Understand why the code exists before judging whether the change addresses the right layer.

- Guard clauses that mask a deeper invariant violation
- Retry logic that hides a broken contract
- Type casts that silence a modeling error
- If you see a workaround, ask: why is the workaround needed? What would a proper fix look like?
- A fix in module A that should really be a fix in module B's contract
- Instructions where structure would be better: if the fix is a comment saying "don't do X" or a convention someone has to remember, ask whether it could instead be a type constraint, a lint rule, or a runtime check that makes the wrong thing impossible

## Structural Integrity

Does the code fit well into the system it's part of?

- Boundary discipline: is validation at system boundaries, or scattered through business logic? Validate data once where it enters the system, then trust it internally.
- Abstraction level: is the code mixing high-level orchestration with low-level detail?
- Coupling: does this change introduce dependencies that will make future changes harder?
- Data model fit: do the data structures match the actual access patterns? The right structure makes downstream code obvious; the wrong one fights you at every turn.
- Bolted-on vs. integrated: was the change patched onto the existing design, or does it read as if the design always accounted for it? If the new requirement had been known from the start, would the code look like this?
- Legacy dual-paths: does the change introduce a new API while keeping the old one alive? If there are no external consumers, migrate callers and delete the old path in the same wave. Don't leave compatibility layers that will become permanent.

Don't penalize simple code for lacking abstraction. Premature abstraction is worse than duplication.

## Verification

Can you tell that this code works from reading it?

- Are there tests? Do they test behavior or implementation details?
- Are there assertions/invariants that would catch regressions?
- If this is a bug fix: is there a test for the bug?
- If this touches an integration boundary: is the full path tested?
- Check the real thing, not a proxy: if the code checks liveness via file mtime or cached state instead of reading the actual value, that's a verification gap.
- For delegated or async work: does the code verify actual output artifacts, or does it trust self-reports and summaries?

## Complexity Budget

Is the complexity justified by what the code accomplishes?

- Code that could be simpler without losing correctness or clarity
- Abstractions that serve only one call site
- Configuration or parameterization for cases that don't exist yet
- Dead code, unused imports, vestigial parameters
- Over-engineering: "just in case" code paths with no current callers
- Obsolete compatibility paths kept alive for transitional stability that's no longer needed. If the migration is done, delete the scaffolding
- Does the user experience justify the complexity? Every feature, control, and option should earn its place. Half-finished features are worse than missing ones.

Simpler is better unless simpler is wrong. Three lines of duplication beat a premature abstraction.

## Security

Only flag security issues you can actually trace through the code. "This could be an injection vector" without showing the input path is not useful.

- User input flowing to dangerous sinks (SQL, shell, eval, innerHTML) without sanitization
- Authentication/authorization gaps in new endpoints
- Secrets in code, logs, or error messages
- TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) in security-critical paths


## Code Quality Lens

# Code Quality Review

Each reviewer applies this code-quality lens in addition to the rubric. It is a strict standard focused on implementation quality, maintainability, abstraction quality, and codebase health.

Above all, be ambitious about code structure. Do not merely identify local cleanup. Actively search for "code judo" moves, restructurings that preserve behavior while making the implementation dramatically simpler, smaller, more direct, and more elegant.

## Core Prompt

Start from this baseline:

> Perform a deep code quality audit of the current branch's changes.
> Rethink how to structure / implement the changes to meaningfully improve code quality without impacting behavior.
> Work to improve abstractions, modularity, reduce Spaghetti code, improve succinctness and legibility.
> Be ambitious, if there is a clear path to improving the implementation that involves restructuring some of the codebase, go for it.
> Be extremely thorough and rigorous. Measure twice, cut once.

## Dimensions

Each dimension is stated once. Apply the ones that are relevant.

0. **Be ambitious about structural simplification.** Do not stop at "this could be a bit cleaner." Look for reframings that make whole branches, helpers, modes, conditionals, or layers disappear. Assume a "code judo" move is often available. It uses the existing architecture more effectively and makes the change dramatically simpler. If you can delete complexity rather than rearrange it, push hard for that.

1. **Do not let a PR push a file from under 1k lines to over 1k lines without a very strong reason.** Treat this as a strong smell. Prefer extracting helpers, subcomponents, or modules. If the diff crosses that threshold, ask whether the code should be decomposed first. Waive only for a compelling structural reason where the resulting file stays clearly organized.

2. **Do not allow spaghetti growth in existing code.** Be suspicious of new ad-hoc conditionals, scattered special cases, or one-off branches inserted into unrelated flows. Treat "weird if statements in random places" as a design problem, not a style nit. Prefer pushing the logic into a dedicated helper, state machine, or module instead of tangling an existing path.

3. **Bias toward cleaning the design, not just accepting working code.** If behavior can stay the same while the structure becomes meaningfully cleaner, push for the cleaner version. Prefer simplifications that remove moving pieces over refactors that spread the same complexity around.

4. **Prefer direct, boring, maintainable code over hacky or magical code.** Treat brittle, ad-hoc, or "magic" behavior as a problem. Be skeptical of generic mechanisms that hide simple data-shape assumptions. Flag thin abstractions, identity wrappers, or pass-through helpers that add indirection without buying clarity.

5. **Push on type and boundary cleanliness when it affects maintainability.** Question unnecessary optionality, `unknown`, `any`, or cast-heavy code when a clearer type boundary could exist. Prefer explicit typed models over loosely-shaped ad-hoc objects. If a branch leans on a silent fallback to paper over an unclear invariant, ask whether the boundary should be made explicit.

6. **Keep logic in the canonical layer and reuse existing helpers.** Call out feature logic leaking into shared paths or implementation details leaking through APIs. Prefer existing canonical utilities over bespoke one-offs. Push code toward the right package, service, or module instead of normalizing drift.

7. **Treat unnecessary sequential orchestration and non-atomic updates as design smells when the cleaner structure is obvious.** If independent work is serialized for no reason, ask whether it should run in parallel. If related updates can leave state half-applied, push for a more atomic structure. Do not over-index on micro-optimizations, but do flag avoidable orchestration complexity that makes the code more brittle.

## Output Expectations

Prioritize structural code-quality regressions and missed simplifications first, then spaghetti and branching complexity, then boundary, type, and file-size concerns, then smaller modularity and legibility issues. Do not flood the review with low-value nits when larger structural issues exist. Prefer a few high-conviction comments over a long list of cosmetic notes.

## Approval Bar

Do not approve merely because behavior seems correct. Treat these as presumptive blockers unless the author can justify them: the PR keeps a lot of incidental complexity when a code-judo move would delete it; pushes a file from below 1000 lines to above 1000 lines; adds ad-hoc branching that tangles an existing flow; scatters feature checks across shared code; adds an unnecessary abstraction, wrapper, or cast-heavy contract; or duplicates an existing helper or puts logic in the wrong layer when there is a clear canonical home. If those conditions are not met, leave explicit, actionable feedback and push for a cleaner decomposition.

## Review Tone

Be direct, serious, and demanding about quality. Do not be rude, but do not soften major maintainability issues into mild suggestions. If the code is making the codebase messier, say so. If the implementation missed an obvious dramatic simplification, say that too. Do not be satisfied with "maybe rename this" when the real issue is structural.


## Instructions

Review the code through every lens in the rubric and the code-quality lens above that you find relevant. Do not force lenses that don't apply.

For each finding, provide:

1. **Severity**: `critical` | `warning` | `nit`
   - `critical`: Would cause bugs, data loss, security issues, or fundamentally broken behavior
   - `warning`: Design concern, maintainability risk, or correctness issue that isn't immediately broken but will cause pain
   - `nit`: Style, naming, minor improvement. Only include nits if they're genuinely useful, not to pad your review.
2. **Finding**: What the problem is, in concrete terms. Reference specific files, lines and functions.
3. **Evidence**: Why you believe this is a problem. Show your reasoning; trace the execution path. Don't just assert.
4. **Suggestion** (optional): What you'd do instead, if you have a concrete alternative.

## What Makes a Good Finding

- It references specific code, not vague concerns
- It explains WHY something is a problem, not just THAT it is
- It distinguishes between "this is broken" and "I would have done this differently"
- It considers the stated intent and the design

## What to Avoid

- Restating what the code does without identifying a problem
- Suggesting rewrites for working code because you'd prefer a different style
- Raising hypothetical issues without evidence that the code path is reachable
- Praising the code. If you find nothing wrong, say "no findings" and stop.

## Output

Markdown, plain sentences. Return your findings as a structured list, most severe first. If you have zero findings, say so.

```
## Findings

### 1. [Severity] Short title
**Location**: file:line or function name
**Finding**: What's wrong
**Evidence**: Why this matters
**Suggestion**: (optional) What to do instead
