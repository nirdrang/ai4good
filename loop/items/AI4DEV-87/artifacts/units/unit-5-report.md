# Unit 5 report

Commit: `e5507775c0de41c026990fd55f1866dce94af3c0`

## The three items

10. The mail poll has one deadline: remaining time goes into each fetch, a matching link stops the raw reads, and the call returns at the deadline even mid-iteration.
11. The above-loop refusal is proven through the real path in `tests/at/harness/live-refusal.selftest.ts` (not the runner-blackbox file): the pinned vitest runs the real req-016 suite at integration with no stack coordinates and all twelve ids fail with the named CapabilityPending.
12. The request shape is pinned: a stubbed fetch asserts the method, URL, and headers `authPost` and `functionPost` send, including the `x-forwarded-for` rule.

  AT-016.03    green    every taxonomy row delivers to exactly its recipients on exactly its channels, with the named payloads
  AT-016.04    green    sensitive negatives: no candidacy to the NGO, no vetting outcome to the volunteer, no donation event
  AT-016.05    green    every critical class goes out by email; the low-tone event is in-app only
  AT-016.06    green    a documented delivery default exists for every taxonomy row
  AT-016.07    green    one logical event per committed event, one delivery per recipient-channel pair, across a restart
  AT-016.08    green    a comment burst delivers the count the pinned anti-spam configuration prescribes, on two different configurations
  AT-016.09    green    every guarded transition writes its notification event atomically under an induced fault
  AT-016.10    green    recipients resolve at event creation: the old holder receives, the new holder is excluded
  AT-016.11    green    sent only on provider acceptance; unconfirmed sends retry; a lost ack mints no duplicate

## Deviations

2.

1. The refusal spawn uses the runner's absolute `--root` and `--config` paths. Relative `tests/at/vitest.config.ts` under `--root tests/at` resolves to `tests/at/tests/at/vitest.config.ts` and vitest does not start.
2. The third-message fixture encodes `=` as `=3D`. A raw `token=abc` is quoted-printable-decoded to `token«c`, so the assertion would pin the decoder, not the stop.
